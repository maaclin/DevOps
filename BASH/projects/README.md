# üß† Bash Scripting Practice Tasks

This folder contains a set of beginner-level Bash scripts I've written while learning the basics of Linux shell scripting. Each script focuses on a different skill like arithmetic, file handling, conditionals, and backups. These were completed as part of the BASH module.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Backup Script ‚Äì `4_backup.sh`

``You'll enter the path to a folder, if it exists the script will look for .txt files and copy them to a Backup folder and if it the directory or file does not exist it will fail and exit. We use ${..}[0] to prevent errors by making sure at least one file exists before copying. ``

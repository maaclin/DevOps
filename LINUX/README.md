# 🐧 Linux Learning Module – OverTheWire + SAD Servers

Welcome to my Linux learning journey! This repo documents my hands-on progress through two amazing resources designed to improve command-line, file handling, and Linux problem-solving skills:

- **[OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)** – a beginner-friendly wargame to learn Linux basics by solving puzzles.
- **[SAD Servers](https://sadservers.com/)** – real-world Linux server issues to troubleshoot and fix.

## 🕹️ OverTheWire: Bandit

> **Goal:** Learn Linux essentials through practical puzzles that increase in complexity.  
> **Progress:** Up to Level 16

Skills covered:
- Navigating the filesystem (`cd`, `ls`, `find`)
- File manipulation (`cat`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `file`)
- Permissions and execution (`chmod`, `./file`)
- SSH and port handling
- Scripting and automation

Each level taught me something new — often requiring a bit of Googling and trial/error, which is exactly how real-world Linux troubleshooting works!

## 🛠️ SAD Servers

> **Goal:** Practice identifying and fixing misconfigured or broken Linux services.  
> **Approach:** I took on challenges ranging from broken Apache configs to failing SSH and DNS services.

What I learned:
- Finding hidden config issues (`grep -r`, `diff`)
- Understanding logs and process states
- Patience and problem-solving under pressure 😅

## ✨ Why I'm Doing This

As part of my Bootcamp with Coderco, I’m deepening my Linux skills to:
- Get comfortable in real terminal environments
- Prepare for DevOps and cloud-based roles (AWS, Docker, etc.)
- Learn by doing — not just theory!

## 🧠 Next Steps

- [ ] Reach Level 15 on Bandit
- [ ] Complete at least 5 SAD Server challenges
- [ ] Write reflection posts on what I’ve learned from the harder puzzles
